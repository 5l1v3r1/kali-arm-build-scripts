Kali-ARM-Build-Scripts
======================

Offensive Security Kali Linux ARM build scripts. We use these to build our official Kali Linux ARM images, 
as can be found at http://www.kali.org/downloads/

- These scripts have only been tested on a Kali Linux 32 and 64 bit installations only, after making sure
that all the dependencies have been installed.
- Make sure you run the build-deps.sh script first, which installs all required dependencies.
